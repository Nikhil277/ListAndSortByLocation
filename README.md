# ListAndSortByLocation

The project is developed in SwiftUI and Xcode 11.5, so I could learn them.
Since I was not able to get the api working (It was giving 504 Gateway Time-out), I used dummy data to display the list.

Note:
- Dummy Data is present in ListData.swift
- I have not used any specific architecture for the project, just seperated the DataModel and LocationManager service

The following are pending:
1. Get values from API
2. Map values received to created DataType.
